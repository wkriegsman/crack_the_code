User Story

This is a code solving game that challenges logic and memory skills. When the user hit the begin play button the program generates a code of four pegs of different colors. There are six possible colors used to create the code.

The player guesses the the possible code by first selecting a color from the grid below the game play board and then clicks on one of the four holes to place the colored peg. When the player is set to see if the selected code matches the solution, the crack the code button is pressed. When this occurs, the program will let the user know how well they did by placing white or black pegs next to the players row of guessed code. A white peg will denote that a colored peg matches one in the code, but is not in the right order. A black peg will denot that the player guessed the correct color and in the correct order. These pegs will not be placed in any particular order themselves.

The user will have ten chances to correctly guess the code.

MVP Pitch

A minimum viable product will allow the user to begin play and the program will generate a random code of colors in a sequence of four. The user will be able to choose colors and place them in a specific order. The user will be able to take their turn and get feedback as to how close they were to the code by seeing a readout of how many correct colors they chose and how many were in the correct sequence. The user will have ten chances to use logic and memory along with the feedback of each turn to match the code. If the user guesses the correct code a message should appear acknowledging the completion of the game and the play button should allow the game to reset.
